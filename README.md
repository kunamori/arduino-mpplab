# Microcontroller with Arduino 🤖

Repository for code backup from Microcontroller Practice Subject.

## 🧰 Hardware Requirements
Arduino UNO R3 Atmega328P (Week 1-5) \
ESP32 (Week 6-7) \
Cables and Breadboard \
Various Components (see individual lab instructions)

## 🗂️ Project Structure
Each week's folder contains multiple labs with self-contained Arduino sketches. 

### Week-by-Week Topics

| Week | Topics | Key Components |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Pin setup, LED control, loops | LEDs, Push buttons |
| 2 | RGB LED, Analog reading | RGB LED, Potentiometers |
| 3 | Hardware interrupts | 7-segment display |
| 4 | LCD display, Sensors | LCD 16x2, DHT22, LDR |
| 5 | Input devices | 4x4 Keypad, RFID |
| 6 | WiFi networking (ESP32) | TCP/IP communication |
| 7 | UDP networking (ESP32) | UDP/IP communication |

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Arduino IDE / Arduino CLI or PlatformIO
# Install required libraries (see libraries.txt)
```

### Running a Lab with Arduino IDE
1. Navigate to desired week/lab folder
2. Open `.ino` file in Arduino IDE
3. Select correct board (UNO or ESP32)
4. Upload to board
